#' # Scaled Scores
#'
#' Scaled scores are used in the calculation of T-scores. In short, the T-scores
#' are based on a regression model that fits the scaled scores as a function of
#' sex, age, and years of education (with some second order terms). The purpose
#' of the scaled scores is to force the data to be more normal looking. For more
#' details, see \insertRef{karstensMayoNormativeStudies2023}{ntrsTscores}.
